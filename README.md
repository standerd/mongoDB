This Project was built using react and express.js.

It connects to mongo DB, so the client side code is dependant on the database connection being established, this project will not work without an internet connection.

To start the project, open the project file in and navigate to the folder in your text editor.

in the main project folder run npm install, which will install the server and it's dependancies.

Once complete cd into the frontend folder and run npm install, this will install react and all of its dependancies.

Once the installation in completed, you need to run npm start in both the main project folder as well the the frontend folder. Running NPM start in both will start both the server localhost and also the react localhost.

React should automatically open a new tab in you default browser, if it does not, please navigate to

http://localhost:3000
